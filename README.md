About
History is written by victors. Every account carries bias from its author, its handlers, and the systems that preserved it. Source Timeline doesn't hide this - it makes it explicit.
Every event is indexed as S.E.P.T.: Source S claims Event E occurred at Place P during Time T. We track the full chain of evidence - who wrote it, when, who handled it, who submitted it. Primary sources, photos, journals, papers. All tagged and traceable.
The interface shows you both dimensions at once. A historical map morphs as you scroll an odometer-style dial through time. Each card on the dial blooms into a full article with its evidence chain visible. Filter by People (Martin Luther King), Places (Shanghai), Things (AI, F-22), or Lens (Religion, Finance, Research, News).
Backlinks connect correlated events. More correlation points plus stronger evidence equals higher probability scores. The AI assistant can trace these chains for you.
Built for researchers, educators, and anyone analyzing how commodity flows, power structures, and narratives actually moved through history - with receipts.
